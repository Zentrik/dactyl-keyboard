# Configuration fragment for magnet pockets, which are holes for magnets to
# hold assortment drawers in place in a Concertina.
#
# Settings here are for cylindrical magnets of actual radius 5 mm, height 2.5
# mm. The magnets are simply centred in each 4 mm shelf, which is suitable for
# small printer nozzles.
