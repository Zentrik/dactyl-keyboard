# Configuration fragment for the base of a Concertina.
#
# This resembles the DMOTE but the hands are vertically oriented, and for this
# reason, the keyboard is joined by a central housing, not split.
# In this base file, the central housing is largely empty.
#
# This version uses only printable dmote-keycap caps and ALPS-style switches.
# The keys are arranged so tightly in places that other types of caps and
# switches should be expected to require adjustment of the keyboard design.
