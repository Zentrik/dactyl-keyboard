# Configuration fragment for removing the rear housing of a DMOTE.

# This fragment is crude. It removes the MCU and 4P4C ports entirely, because
# without a rear housing, there is no longer an obvious place for them. Though
# it moves screw anchors for the bottom plate, it leaves the bottom plate
# itself in a slightly flawed state.

# The purpose of the file is not to provide a working keyboard, but to answer a
# frequently asked question about the DMOTE application:
# Which settings get rid of the rear housing and close the case?

by-key:
  # Extend the north wall of most of the main key cluster to the ground.
