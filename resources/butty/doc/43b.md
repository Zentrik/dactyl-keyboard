This has a visible effect in `body-main.yaml`, cutting 2 mm off the bottom of
its wall to maintain a constant overall height. More importantly, the
application produces a whole new file of output, called
`bottom-plate-case.scad`. It looks something like this:

![The bottom plate without special configuration](img/butty/bottom-1-base.png)

⤤ This is a bottom plate that will fit perfectly under Butty’s main body, but
there’s a hole in it. This is because the tweaks we created in the last part of
this tutorial cover the roof and walls, but they don’t tell the application
precisely where to fill in the floor. We’re going to fix that by adding another
property to the first tweak we made in `butty.yaml`, right under
`above-ground`.
