In this version of `butty.yaml`, the `by-key` section has both `parameters` for
the whole keyboard and two other sets of `parameters`: One for each corner at
Butty’s back.

The wall we have seen so far is drawn between eight sides of Butty, designated
by eight intermediate points of the compass. By providing exceptions for the
“north by northeast” and “north by northwest” sides, restoring default settings
for those sides alone, we break the wall where we want to. The metaphor of the
compass is explained [here](configuration.md).

It’s a clean cut. Here’s another angle:

## Summary

In this part of the tutorial, we have learned:

* How to make walls with `extent` and `to-ground`.
* How to target the sides of a key: Using the names of compass points.
* How to make exceptions.

In [part 3](tutorial-1c.md), we’ll add a microcontroller.
