Notice that this new tweak has two nodes at the top level, right under the
name. These are not hulled with one another.

It looks neat enough from the outside, and the inside of Butty is still hollow,
so we’re good.

## Summary

In this part of the tutorial, we have learned:

* How to name a key for use as an anchor of tweaks.
* How to use tweaks with `hull-around`, `chunk-size` and `to-ground`.
* That nodes of a tweak behave differently, depending on
  the type of their anchor.

In the last part of this tutorial, [part 5](tutorial-1e.md), we’re going to
add a bottom plate.
