![The MCU made visible](img/butty/mcu-2-preview.png)

⤤ That low, flat thing poking out of the new hole in the front is the MCU’s
circuit board. Inside the keyboard case, it has a small USB connector on the
far end, directly under the middle of Butty’s single key mounting plate, that
is at xy-coordinates `[0, 0]`.

If you have the file open in OpenSCAD’s preview mode, the board is a different
colour from the case because you can’t print a working MCU on an FDM printer.
It’s only showing up now for a visualization of how Butty is going to look
*after assembly*, hence the name of the setting, `preview`. Non-printability is
the reason why `preview` is disabled by default, and should be disabled before
you print.

## Moving the MCU to the rear housing

The hole over the MCU—the only thing we saw without `preview`—is made by the
DMOTE application to provide room for the components on the circuit board.
However, the MCU will do no good where it is. We want it inside Butty, safe
from dust and poking humans.

Let’s move the MCU. Change just the `mcu` section again in `butty.yaml`, adding
an `anchoring` subsection to it.
