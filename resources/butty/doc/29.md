⤤ This is similar to the `anchoring` section for the `main` key cluster in
Butty’s configuration, but it’s more detailed. We have specified that the MCU’s
position should be based on the rear housing’s position: Its `anchor` is the
automatically defined name `rear-housing-interior` instead of the implicit
default `origin` of the coordinate system.

⤥ The result is to put Butty’s MCU inside the rear housing.

As a side effect, there is no longer a hole in the front.

Now that the MCU is in a reasonable place, we no longer need to preview it, so
you can remove the line that sets `preview: true`. Running without it, here’s a
view from the back:

⤤ With the MCU in its proper place and the preview disabled, there is now room
for a micro USB port in Butty’s back.

That hole for a USB connector is not part of the rear housing itself. It’s part
of the MCU, and specifically of the default type of MCU, which is a Pro Micro.
The `anchoring` settings now in `butty.yaml`, together with the precise
settings for the `rear-housing`, put that hole through the back wall. After
all, you will need to connect the MCU to your computer.

## Summary

In this part of the tutorial, we have learned:

* How to include a rear housing.
* How to include an MCU.
* How to preview a non-printable part of the keyboard.
* How to anchor one part to another part to good effect.

In [part 4](tutorial-1d.md), we’ll tweak the case.
