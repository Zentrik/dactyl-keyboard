Default `extent` is 0. The parameter is documented [here](options-nested.md).

The command to run the application is, and will continue to be:

`# lein run -c config/base.yaml -c butty.yaml`

Here’s `body-main.scad` with the new configuration:

![Mounting plate bevel](img/butty/bevel.png)

A bevel has appeared, lining the edge of the keyboard. Here’s how it works:

The keyboard case extends from each key mount. At the edge of a key cluster—as
on every side of Butty—there is a wall. This wall was at `extent` 0, meaning
the edge of the mounting plate, so we couldn’t see it.

Walls are built one segment at a time. Segments are points in space around the
key mount. Segment 0 is a corner of the plate itself. The position of segment
1, relative to segment 0, is determined for us in `base.yaml`, the bundled base
configuration file.  Here’s an excerpt from `base.yaml`:

```yaml
    wall:
      segments:
        "1":
          intrinsic-offset: [0,  1, -1]  # Top bevel.
```

This setting means that segment 1 is 1 mm out from each corner of Butty, and 1
mm down. By connecting each corner with a point off that corner at those
coordinates, in a rotating frame of reference specific to each side, we get a
bevel all the way round.

## Bringing the wall to the ground

Change `butty.yaml` to have the following contents, and run the application
again.
