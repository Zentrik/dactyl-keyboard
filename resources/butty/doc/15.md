![Wall to ground](img/butty/to-ground.png)

⤤ The wall of the keyboard case now extends vertically from the segment
specified by our setting for `extent` all the way to the ground at z-coordinate
0. The total height of the case is 10 mm, given by our `extrinsic-offset`.

You see there is still room inside the case for a key switch. You could print
this version of Butty, mount a switch in it, and click away to your heart’s
content.

## An opening to the north

Butty is a single-button keyboard, but even a single-button keyboard needs more
parts than just a button. In order to send signals to a computer, Butty needs a
microcontroller. We will be adding one of those in part 3. For now, we’ll
prepare by opening up a hole in the wall on Butty’s back side.

We do this by specifying exceptions to the settings we have already made.
