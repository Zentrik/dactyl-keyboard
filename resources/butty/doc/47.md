Add that to `butty.yaml`, save it and run the application once more.

⤤ The change adds two internally threaded bosses for M3 screws inside the case.
It also adds countersinks for the same screws’ heads, which go into the bottom
plate.

The placement of each boss uses anchoring parameters, the same way we have seen
elsewhere, but automatically drops to the floor because of properties already
defined for `main-bottom-plate` in `base.yaml`.

Inside the case, there are notches cut into the two bosses. These notches are
made by the invisible model of the MCU’s circuit board. They show that the
bosses are properly aligned to support the MCU without preventing assembly.

## Summary

In this part of the tutorial we have learned:

* How to include a bottom plate for the main body.
* How to tweak the bottom plate without touching the main body.
* How to add fasteners for assembly.

This illustrated tour of some DMOTE application features is at an end.  Feel
free to modify the configuration further as you explore the
[options](options-main.md), or print a copy of Butty as is, for a hardcore 1%
keyboard experience.
