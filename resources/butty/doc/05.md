Save `butty.yaml` with those shorter contents, then run the application,
repeating the last command to do so. The output will be the same as before
because the setting we removed from `butty.yaml` was made superfluous by the
addition of `base.yaml`.

This kind of simplification is good for maintenance. If you want to have two
kinds of Butty later on—perhaps a two-button Tutty model—you can maintain the
alternate version as yet another separate file that comes after `butty.yaml`
and duplicates nothing in `butty.yaml`. That is how the bundled configurations
work. The application never changes the contents of a configuration file.

## Summary

In this tutorial, we have learned:

* How to run the application and view the results.
* How to get something to show up by creating a configuration file.
* How to combine multiple configuration files, including a bundled one.
* To keep it simple.

In [part 2](tutorial-1b.md), we’ll add walls.
