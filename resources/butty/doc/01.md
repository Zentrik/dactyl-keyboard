# Tutorial: Butty the single-button keyboard (part 1)

This article is a beginner’s guide to the DMOTE application. It’s about getting
started designing your own keyboard from scratch, proceeding to a tiny but
usable original design for a keyboard case.

For installation instructions and a broader conceptual overview than the one
offered here, try the [introduction](intro.md).

Our example project in this tutorial is named Butty. Butty says hi.

## Running on empty

As our very first step toward designing Butty, let’s just see what happens
when we run the application without a keyboard design. This is the command to
do that:

`# lein run`

Here, `#` represents your prompt at your command line, where you type only
`lein run` followed by Enter. For this to work, your terminal must be in the
DMOTE application’s directory on your computer.

[Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/) runs the application, which creates a
couple of new files under `things/scad`, that is the `scad` folder inside the
`things` folder inside the application directory. One of the new files you have
created is called `body-main.scad`. If you open that file in
[OpenSCAD](https://www.openscad.org/), you see this view of your keyboard:

The file itself is not empty, but no model is visible. Butty is not yet born.

## The smallest configuration that shows something

We have learned that you can’t see anything when you run the application
without specifying a configuration. That is because the application has the
simplest possible built-in default configuration. This configuration actually
includes a single key for Butty, but shows no model because:

* The single key is placed at an elevation of zero. It disappears into the
  ground.
* The mounting plate for the key switch is 1 mm in size, but the key switch
  itself is of a real-world, ALPS-compatible type, larger than 1 mm. The
  mounting plate is therefore consumed by the switch it should support.

Let’s fix those problems now, by starting our project.

With a text editor, such as Vim or Notepad++, create a file called `butty.yaml`
in the project directory. Put the following text inside the file:
