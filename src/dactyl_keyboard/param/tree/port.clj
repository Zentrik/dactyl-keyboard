    "* An external USB port for interfacing with your computer, such as a "
    "full-size USB A port. You might want this when your MCU either has no "
    "such port attached or the attached port is too weak for direct human "
    "use (cf. `shelf`) or difficult to get into a good position.\n"
    "* Additional USB ports, connected via internal hub or to an "
    "integrated microphone clip, phone charger etc.\n"
